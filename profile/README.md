# About MythForge Studios

Welcome to MythForge Studios, the imaginative realm where strategy meets storytelling. Founded by Elias Singh, a passionate game developer from Sweden, MythForge is dedicated to crafting unique gaming experiences that blend deep strategic gameplay with rich roleplaying elements.

## Meet the Founder: Elias Singh

Starting his game development journey at 13 making games in Unity, Elias (now 20) makes mechanically ambitious games in Godot. 

Born and raised in Sweden with a profound love for both strategy games and immersive roleplaying, Elias combines these passions to create games that not only challenge the mind but also tell captivating stories.

## Our Mission

MythForge Studios was born out of a desire to innovate the way strategy games are played. Our mission is to:

- **Engage Players Intellectually**: We believe in creating games that challenge your long-term planning and ability to predict consequences.
- **Immerse Fully in Dynamic Stories**: Each game is built to be replayed, creating unique, dynamic, and ultimately personal stories.
- **Foster a Community**: We aim to build games that bring people together, sharing stories and experiences.

## Our Games

At MythForge Studios, we are committed to developing games that are both mechanically deep and rich with detail, while also easy to get into and fitting for a group of players with varying experience levels.

### Current Projects

- **"Dwurfheim"**:  Playing as a dwarven deity; compete, collaborate, and betray your friends in order to ensure the survival, and ultimately dominance, of your people.

### Future Endeavors

We are always brewing new ideas and exploring possibilities. Stay tuned for more epic adventures and strategic challenges.
